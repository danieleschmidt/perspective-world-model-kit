# Project Charter: Perspective World Model Kit (PWMK)

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
To develop the world's leading open-source framework for neuro-symbolic multi-agent AI systems with Theory of Mind capabilities, enabling breakthrough research in perspective-aware artificial intelligence and human-AI collaboration.

### Vision
A future where AI systems can understand and reason about the beliefs, intentions, and perspectives of multiple agents, enabling more natural, effective, and trustworthy human-AI interaction across diverse domains.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Limited Theory of Mind in AI**: Most AI systems lack the ability to model what other agents know or believe
2. **Fragmented Research Tools**: No unified framework combining neural learning with symbolic reasoning for multi-agent scenarios
3. **Scalability Issues**: Existing approaches don't scale to realistic multi-agent environments
4. **Integration Barriers**: Difficulty integrating ToM capabilities into existing RL and AI systems
5. **Evaluation Gaps**: Lack of standardized benchmarks for perspective-aware AI systems

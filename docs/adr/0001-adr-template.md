# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

## Status
Template

## Context
We need a standardized format for documenting architectural decisions in the Perspective World Model Kit project. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help us track the reasoning behind important design choices and their consequences.

## Decision
We will use the following template for all ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Short Title of Solved Problem and Solution]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement that led to this decision]

## Decision
[State the architecture decision and explain the reasoning]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List positive consequences]

### Negative  
- [List negative consequences or tradeoffs]

### Neutral
- [List neutral consequences or implications]

## Implementation Notes
[Any specific implementation details or constraints]

## Related Decisions
- [Link to related ADRs]
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Standardized documentation format across the project
- Clear tracking of architectural evolution
- Easier onboarding for new contributors
- Historical context for future decisions

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead
- Risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not maintained

### Neutral
- ADRs are stored in the `docs/adr/` directory
- Numbered sequentially starting from 0001

## Implementation Notes
- ADRs should be created for significant architectural decisions
- Each ADR should be self-contained and understandable
- ADRs should be reviewed and approved through the standard PR process
- Deprecated ADRs should remain in the repository for historical reference

## Related Decisions
None (this is the template ADR)
